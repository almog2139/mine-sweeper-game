**Minesweeper** is a classic puzzle game built with **Vanilla JavaScript**. The goal of the game is to clear a grid of hidden mines without detonating any of them. The game provides an interactive interface where players can reveal tiles and mark suspected mines.

## Features

- **Grid-based gameplay**: A grid with tiles that may contain mines or numbers indicating nearby mines.
- **Mine marking**: Right-click to flag a tile as a suspected mine.
- **Timer**: Track how long it takes to clear the board without hitting any mines.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: The game is implemented using pure JavaScript, without any external libraries.

## How to Play

1. **Reveal a tile**: Click on a tile to reveal what's underneath. If itâ€™s a mine, the game ends.
2. **Mark a mine**: Right-click on a tile to flag it as a suspected mine.
3. **Clear the grid**: Continue revealing tiles until all non-mined tiles are cleared, without triggering any mines.
